# Subscription Flow - Complete Healthcare Platform Implementation

## Objective
To build a robust, user-friendly, and future-ready subscription management system that serves as a benchmark for healthcare platforms with subscription-based models.

---

## 1. End-to-End Subscription Lifecycle

### 1.1 Plan Discovery & Selection
- User browses available subscription plans (filtered by category, features, price, etc.).
- If required, user completes an assessment questionnaire before purchasing a plan.
- System provides plan details and recommendations.

### 1.2 Assessment Questionnaire (if applicable)
- Before purchasing a plan, the user completes an assessment questionnaire (if required by the plan/category).
- The user's responses are securely stored and, after purchase, made available to the assigned provider.
- The provider reviews the assessment responses to gain an overview of the user's health, preferences, or needs before the first consultation or service.

### 1.3 Subscription Purchase/Activation
- User selects a plan and provides payment details.
- Stripe customer and subscription are created; payment method is attached.
- Internal subscription record is created, linking user, plan, Stripe ID, and status.
- Privilege usage counters are initialized.

### 1.4 Active Subscription Period
- User accesses plan privileges (consults, messages, video calls, etc.).
- Usage is tracked and enforced; notifications sent as limits approach/exceed.
- Recurring payments handled by Stripe; invoices and receipts managed.

### 1.5 Renewal, Pause, Upgrade, or Cancellation
- Stripe auto-renews at billing cycle end; usage counters reset.
- User/admin can pause, resume, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions.
- Access and billing are updated accordingly; notifications and audits triggered.

### 1.6 End of Subscription
- Optional grace period after failed payment or cancellation.
- Data retention per compliance requirements.
