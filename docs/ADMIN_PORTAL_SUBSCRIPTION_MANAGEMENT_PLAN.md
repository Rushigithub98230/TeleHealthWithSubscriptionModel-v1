## 📊 API Endpoints Mapping

### Frontend Components → Backend APIs

#### SubscriptionPlansComponent
```

POST /webadmin/subscription-management/categories → Create category
PUT /webadmin/subscription-management/categories/{id} → Update category
DELETE /webadmin/subscription-management/categories/{id} → Delete category
```

#### SubscriptionAnalyticsComponent
```

GET /webadmin/subscription-management/analytics/churn-rate → Get churn rate
GET /webadmin/subscription-management/analytics/revenue-trends → Get revenue trends
```

#### SubscriptionBulkActionsComponent
```
POST /webadmin/subscription-management/bulk-actions/cancel → Bulk cancel
POST /webadmin/subscription-management/bulk-actions/pause → Bulk pause
POST /webadmin/subscription-management/bulk-actions/resume → Bulk resume
POST /webadmin/subscription-management/bulk-actions/extend → Bulk extend

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Requirements
- All controllers must use `[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]`
- All endpoints must return `ApiResponse<T>` format
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use existing services (SubscriptionService, CategoryService, etc.)
- Follow existing patterns and conventions

### Frontend Requirements
- All services must handle loading states
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Angular reactive forms for data input
- Implement proper validation
- Add success/error notifications

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend** → Makes API call to backend
2. **Backend** → Processes request using existing services
3. **Backend** → Returns `ApiResponse<T>` with data
4. **Frontend** → Updates UI with real data
5. **Frontend** → Shows success/error messages

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and services
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Local Testing**: Run both frontend and backend locally
